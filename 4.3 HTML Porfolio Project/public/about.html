<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I have been a nurse for 30 years and during Covid I stumbled upon an a low cost beginners coding boot camp.
My wife and I started and completed it together and afterward I said to myself; "Hey, I think I really have something
here."I also took up a great interest in statistics, math and science that I just did not have
before. Who knew a global pandemic could bring out my inner Geek.
</P>

<p>During the pandemic I also became painfully aware that I had no marketable skills to fall back on outside of
  nursing. This is something that I feel determined to remedy with a renewed zest for lifelong learning and skills
  acquisition. This discovery has liberated me from no longer feeling stuck in a rut.
</p>

<p>Robert Green is oft quoted as saying:"A Jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one".
  What I have taken from this quote, now seeing it with new eyes, is don't be content with only a superficial layer
  of knowledge on topics of interest but really deep dive as that is the only place that you find all of life's 
  vast treasures. Henceforth, I am commiting myself to discovering all I can in the programming space. 
  Blessings to you and yours.
